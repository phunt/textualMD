# Test Bullet Lists

## Regular Bullets

* First item
* Second item
* Third item

## Nested Bullets

* Parent item
  * Child item 1
  * Child item 2
* Another parent
  * Another child

## Numbered List

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item

## Mixed Content

* Item with **bold** text
* Item with *italic* text
* Item with `code` text

## Long Items

* This is a very long bullet point that should wrap to multiple lines to test how the rendering handles line wrapping in bullet lists
* Another long item that contains multiple sentences. This helps us see if the issue is related to line length or wrapping behavior.
