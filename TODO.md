## Known Issues
* Bullet list rendering: In Textual v5.0.1, bullet points and their text appear on separate lines in the Markdown widget. This appears to be a limitation of the widget's internal rendering that cannot be fixed through CSS or text preprocessing alone. No specific GitHub issue has been filed for this problem yet
